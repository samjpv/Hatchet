# Hatchet
## Usage
### Set up information for purchasing
#### 1. Locate the InfoFilePath.txt file in the repository. You will notice that it by default contains 'C:\Users\*\Documents\HatchetUserInfo.txt'. This indicates the path on your local machine to your C drive documents where you will have to create a user information text file, the format of which will be specified in this document. You can change this path if you wish to have your user information file stored elsewhere, but an incorrect path will likely crash the program.<br/>
#### 2. Create a text file named HatchetUserInfo.txt in the directory that has been specified in InfoFilePath.txt. This file contains semi-sensitive user information for the purpose of filling out checkout forms on the website you are purchasing from. Its format as is follows:<br/>
email: person@website.com<br/>
phone: 1112223333<br/>
firstname: john<br/>
lastname: doe<br/>
address: 1 helloworld street<br/>
city: flavortown<br/>
state: CA<br/>
zipcode: 11111<br/>
#### * More sensitive information will be prompted by the program at runtime.
